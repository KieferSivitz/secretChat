# Secret Chat
The goal of this project is to create an open source peer to peer encrypted chat client. The goal of which is to have a simple, reliable chat client that is known to be secure. I'm creating this because I want to be able to talk to people and know that my client is uncompromised, and I want to maintain the integrity of my messages. And I want others to be able to do the same thing.
