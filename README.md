# secretChat
This is a side project of mine to create an end to endencrypted p2p chat application. To learn more about and solidify my current knowledge of networks.

## Installation Instructions (Linux)
This program uses pyqt5 and python 3, and as such both of these must be installed for it to work.
If one or both of these are already installed on the machine, these steps can be skipped.

To install pyqt5 the command is:

	`sudo apt-get install pyqt5`

To install python3 the command is:

	`sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5`

If git is not already installed on your machine, it can be installed with the following command:

	`sudo apt-get install git`

Once you have downloaded everything necessary to run the program, clone this repository onto your machine
using the following command:

	`git clone https://github.com/KieferSivitz/secretChat.git`

Then navigate intto the directory containing the files:

	`cd secretChat`

And the following command will start the program:

	`python3 secretChat.py`
