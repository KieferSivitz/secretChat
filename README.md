# Secret Chat
The goal of this project is to create an open source peer to peer encrypted chat client. The goal of which is to have a simple, reliable chat client that is known to be secure. I'm creating this because I want to be able to talk to people and know that my client is uncompromised, and I want to maintain the integrity of my messages. And I want others to be able to do the same thing.

## Installation Instructions (Linux)

	wget "https://github.com/KieferSivitz/secretChat/setup"
	bash setup

### Feel free to leave any or all of the questions blank, as the certificates are generated for encryption but not authentication

Once the setup is complete move into the folder containing the program

	cd secretChat.py

The following command will start the program:

	python3 secretChat.py
